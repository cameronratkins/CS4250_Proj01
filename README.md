Lexical Analyzer in Java

Write the program implementing lexical analyzer (see Section 4.2) in Java. Update the code implementing lexical analyzer  so that it will recognize the following lexemes: comma (,), semicolon (;) and a reserved word int. 
Since the original program does not have code for processing an assignment operator, you have to add it.

For submission, run your program twice. The first time your input should be an expression discussed in the textbook:

( sum + 47 ) / total

For this input line your output should be identical to what we see in the book.

The second time use the following line as input:   

int a, b = 3;
